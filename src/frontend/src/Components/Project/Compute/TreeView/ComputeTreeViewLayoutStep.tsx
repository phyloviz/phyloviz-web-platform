    [ComputeTreeViewLayout.FORCE_DIRECTED]: "Force-directed layout is a physical simulation of a system of particles, which are connected by springs. The algorithm is iterative and the simulation is performed in discrete steps. At each step, the forces acting on each particle are computed and the positions of the particles are updated. The algorithm stops when the system reaches a stable state, i.e. when the forces are balanced and the particles are not moving anymore. The algorithm is based on the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm.",

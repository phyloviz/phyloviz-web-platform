PHYLOViZ Web Platform is a web-based tool for phylogenetic analysis, developed in the context of
the [PHYLOViZ](https://www.phyloviz.net/) initiative.

The PHYLOViZ Web Platform allows users to access and perform phylogenetic analyses and visualizations from anywhere
with an internet connection, without requiring installation of software or access to high-performance computing
resources.

Benefiting from a highly **modular architecture**, the PHYLOViZ Web Platform offers exceptional flexibility and
extensibility. It allows for effortless integration of novel analysis methods and tools, empowering researchers to stay
at the forefront of biomedical research.

Discover the power and versatility of the PHYLOViZ Web Platform, and unlock new insights into phylogenetic data
analysis, by visiting the [PHYLOViZ Web Platform](https://web.phyloviz.net/) website.

## Key Features

* **Modular Architecture**: The platform has a modular architecture that unifies both versions of PHYLOViZ and allows
  for easy integration of new analysis methods and tools.
* **Web-Based**: It is a web-based tool, accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, without requiring
  installation of software or access to high-performance computing resources;
* **Advanced Data Management**: The platform has advanced data management capabilities, including efficient storage and
  retrieval of large phylogenetic datasets;
* **Optimization Capabilities**: The platform includes optimization capabilities for inference and visualization tasks,
  which are performed server-side using a workflow engine, to avoid limitations of the client-side;
* **Support for Epidemiological and Ancillary data**: The platform integrates epidemiological and ancillary data for
  isolates under study, enhancing the visualization and exploration of inference results;
* **User-friendly interface**: The platform has a user-friendly interface for performing phylogenetic analyses and
  visualizations.
